1) The only answer that changed slightly was #1. We decided instead of opening up our app to users of all sports that we would keep it to sports that are played in pairs (tennis, squashâŠ) The app still facilitates getting to know people in your area through the helpful medium of sports.

2) We currently have a dynamic database (mySQL), a page to register users, a âprofile pageâ for each user, a method that finds all the people in your area that play your sport, as well a basic Firebase-bases chat your to connect you to any user you would like to chat with. The chatroom is not fully completed (we are still trying to figure out how to connect the other user to the same chat room.)

3) No, the elements listed above are what we consider crucial to the functionality of our app and are for the most part they are done.

4) An additional feature that we would like to implement is a calendar so that when users make plans they can put it in their personal schedules and this receive reminders and updates.

5) We are using Ruby on Rails.

6) On the front end we are using Jquery.

7) Google Chrome

8) When trying to host the website, I (Emma) kind of messed up and lost a little functionality in the process so I need to fix  and the login page. I know it is a hassle, but that code does exist in our gituhub. Sorry about that.
