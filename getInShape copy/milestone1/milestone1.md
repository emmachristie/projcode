Milestone 1
=========

User Research
--------------

1) Our application addresses the problem that people encounter when they first start getting into shape. That is the lack of education in proper exercise routines to match their goal and proper workout technique.
Our application addresses this problem by being an all inclusive personalized information resource for people wanting to get in shape.

2) While our application will have a personalized workout tracker that will help users stay on top of their schedule, the home run feature of our app will be the crowd-sourcing of workout questions. One of the hardest parts for people trying to get into shape is lack of knowledge. There are many pertinent question regarding proper technique and useful tips that if answered will optimize the user’s workout. (See StackOverFlow.)

3) We envision that anyone who would like to have a more structured and information based exercise routine would use our site.

4) Our uses is logging on to see is scheduled for them that day.
Log on → recieves semi personalized workout routine for the day → review exercises for unfamiliar moves if found → view videos that teach proper technique → workout → if user encounters problems during workout that aren’t resolved by videos, user can search/post question on forum → review discussions about issue

MVP
------

1) We plan on implementing the calendar and the forum in our MVP. These are both critical for the the functioning of our site. In its simplest form our site acts both as a calendar that helps the user keep track of their workout schedule and daily tasks, as well as a resource to help them learn more about working out and proper technique. 

2) We would like to develop some method of helping the user choose a pre-planned workout that they can fit into their calendar, but this is not critical for implementation in our MVP. Once we are certain that the calendar works properly then we can consider what we want to put into it.

3) As part of our website acting as an information resource we will have a library of videos and written instructions on how to do certain exercises. There are a set of very common FAQ that most people working out for the first time will ask, there is no need for them to go through the forum for such basic questions. We will probably have a minimal implementation of the library in our MVP.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:

1)  Emma Christie, emchris7@mit.edu, MIT, 6-3, Undergrad ;                            
   Aaron Zwiebach, aaronz@mit.edu, MIT, 18c, Undergrad

2) Health and Fitness

3) Most likely Ruby on Rails

4) The most likely risk is lack of knowledge about working out, it is very easy to get bogged down in the actual picking of materials for getting our users started, this has nothing to do with actual web design, so we will need to be careful not to spend too much time on that.
5) Rookie
