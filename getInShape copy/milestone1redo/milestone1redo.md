USER RESEARCH:
-----
1) Our application helps people find other people in their area to play pick-up sports with. The app matches you with other people based on your geographic location and skill level.

2) The killer feature for our app is the pairing tool. The hardest part of getting on the court to play is having people to play with. This crucial element of the app will find people in your area that are also looking for people to play with.

3) We envision anyone, on any skill level, looking to play Basketball, Soccer, or Tennis to use our App. Even people who are experienced players may have a hard time finding other to play with.

4) User logs on→ indicates that they wish to play basketball→ indicates their skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) → indicates their location (either by granting the app the right to use their location or by entering it themselves) → indicates how far they are willing to travel → indicates how large of a game they want (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 5x5) → submit date/time when they want to play → APP does location based search for people → App uses google maps to suggest a few park options (or if applicable places where courts can be reserved) → puts players in contact in a chatroom on the website → players chat over message board in order to finalize location and coordinate equipment.

MVP:
-----
1) For our MVP we will definitely implement unique user log-in, as well as the method for grouping players together.

2) For our MVP we may just implement the APP for basketball only, once we are certain that that works, it will be easy to expand it to other sports (Soccer, Tennis…) We also hope to add on other features such as syncing the app with your calendar and email to send you reminders.

3) Depending on how arduous of a task it is to set up the pairing system we may downplay some of the aesthetic at first. We also want to be certain that the safety of our users is insured, we may include a method to report bad behavior in order to exclude certain users.

2) Urban living, exploration, and Transportation

3) Ruby on Rails

4) The task that we think will be the most challenging is coming up with an efficient method to pair together groups, making sure not to double count people, and being careful to take into account all possible edge cases.
